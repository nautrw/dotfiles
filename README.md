# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles
## Getting started
You might have to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` when you clone the Git repo. This is so that every submodule updates.<br>
You will also have to install the following packages:
```
zsh kitty
```
Afterward, you can move the files into your home directory.

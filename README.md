# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles
## Getting started
Assuming you are on a fresh install of EndeavourOS, with both `yay` and `make` installed, just `cd` into the dotfiles directory and run `make endeavour`. This will install the dotfiles.
In cases where you want to delete the files created by the command, just run `make uninstall` to remove everything. If the install, for whatever reason fails, just uninstall and run again.

At the end, just reboot (running `reboot` is an easy way to do so) to make changes take place.
